Louisville
 <LINE> <LINE>
Louisville is the most populated city in Kentucky, with more than 600,000 inhabitants.
When the zombie apocalypse started, the U.S. Army set up a containment cordon to prevent
 the spread of zombies from the city. It's been quiet for days, and the military checkpoint
 on the highway seems abandoned. Nobody knows what's going on in the city, but it's safe to
 say that it is one of the most dangerous places in Kentucky.
