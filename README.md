# Louisville-Spawns
Louisville Spawn Mod for Project Zomboid.
The mod adds spawns for all classes, they are purposely made in a way that reflects the backgroud picked when starting a character.
This means, the majority of the spawns are in and around points of interest, making them particularly difficult. Moreover, for each class
there is one spawn that is extra difficult.
